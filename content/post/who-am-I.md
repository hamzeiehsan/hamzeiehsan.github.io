Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Ehsan, a skilled developer and data scientist with a broad range of experience in Java, big data technologies, and spatial data science. My career journey started as a Java Developer, where I developed Enterprise Service Bus and integrated multiple systems. During this time, I learned how to use JMS, Database, Apache Camel, Java FX, and Apache Karaf. I then progressed to working as a senior Java Developer, where I developed a new summarization program using big data technologies, including Hadoop, Spark, and NLP and Machine Learning. I also helped the team develop Java Web Services using Spring technologies for the portal.

Later on, I began working as a BI developer, where I was a senior member of the team, managing several members, and working as a Data Engineer. I wrote efficient SQL queries, wrote scripts for Oracle Data Integrator, wrote ML code to gain insights from data, and helped the dashboard and analytics team with my spatial data science skills.

After moving to Australia, I started working as a graduate researcher on automatic question answering of spatial questions. I presented my work in several conferences and wrote high-quality journal papers, managed several workshops, and contributed to the community with open-source codes.

Following my PhD, I worked on various projects, including creating a coherent spatiotemporal data warehouse for Australia. I mainly used Python and R for coding and created a data warehouse that includes several environmental, health, demographic, crime, and economic variables. I also worked as a developer to create a spatial question answering system. Later, I began my research fellow work on ARC and HIP AURIN projects. Recently, I worked on a project to estimate daytime population using internet usage data. I dealt with big data challenges, designed the estimation process, and wrote efficient R code to manage the project successfully.

I am passionate about using my expertise to solve real-world problems and have a proven track record of delivering results for complex projects. If you're looking for a skilled and experienced developer to tackle big data challenges, you've come to the right place.
